# MusicalStructureApp
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. 
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music. 
This project is about combining various ideas and skills learned from the android basics nanodegree program by udacity.

    Creating new activities
    Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
    Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
    Creating your own Custom Class
